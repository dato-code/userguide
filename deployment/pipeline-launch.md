# Asynchronous Job Executions

Let's start with the "Hello World" of deployment examples: adding two numbers. In the following code, we will do the following:

- Write a simple python function to add two numbers.
- Execute the function asynchronously on your local machine.


#### Local Asynchronous Jobs

In this code snippet, we will create a job which can add two numbers, execute it locally, and get the results (and exceptions if the function failed).
 
First, create the Python function. Then pass the name and the function keyword arguments that you want to run with into [``job.create()``](https://dato.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.deploy.job.create.html).

```python
import graphlab as gl

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Execute the job.
job = gl.deploy.job.create(add, x=1, y=1)
```

To get the results of this execution, simply call [``job.get_results()``](https://dato.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.deploy.Job.get_results.html).

```python
print job.get_results()
```
```
2
```

To get the status of this execution, simply call [``job.get_status()``](https://dato.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.deploy.Job.get_status.html)

```python
print job.get_status()
```
```
Completed
```

If the execution of this function throws an exception, we can get the exception type, message, and traceback from the job metrics. See [``job.get_metrics()``](https://dato.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.deploy.Job.get_metrics.html).

```python
# Will fail since y is None
job = gl.deploy.job.create(add, x=1, y=None)
metrics = job.get_metrics()

print metrics
```
```

[1 rows x 7 columns]
```

```python
# get exception type and exception message
print metrics[0]['exception'] + ": " + metrics[0]['exception_message']
```
```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'
```

To visualize this job execution, use [``job.show()``](https://dato.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.deploy.Job.show.html)

```python
job.show()
```

That should give you a sense of the types of tasks that can be accomplished
with this API. In the following more practical example, we build a recommender
and then execute it remotely.
